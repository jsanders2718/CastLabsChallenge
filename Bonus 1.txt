The box header provides a 32 bit size field. For large MDAT files this may not be sufficient, so the version 1 box (ISO14496-12 section 6.2.2) with extended size may be used. The preence of the extnded field is signalled by size = 1 as shown in ISO14496-12 section 4.2 as follows:-

aligned(8) class Box (unsigned int(32) boxtype,
     optional unsigned int(8)[16] extended_type) {
  unsigned int(32) size;
  unsigned int(32) type = boxtype;
  if (size==1) {
      unsigned int(64) largesize;
  } else if (size==0) {
    // box extends to end of file
  }
  if (boxtype==‘uuid’) {
     unsigned int(8)[16] usertype = extended_type;
   }
}
